# wp-reamo
**Work-in-progress Wordpress theme built with React and Mobx**
This project is currently only a single page react app. Upcoming commits will make it possible to build and then install into Wordpress as a theme.

## Instructions
This project was initially [ejected](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#converting-to-a-custom-setup) with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Take a look at the project's [readme](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md) for details on what the general capabilities are for such projects.

### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vuldin/wp-reamo.git
cd wp-reamo
npm i
npm run build
```

For development or running the app outside of Wordpress, just follow up the above build steps with `npm start`.
